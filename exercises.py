# Exercise 1: Calculate Area of a Triangle
#
# Write a function named `calculate_area_triangle` that takes the base and height of a triangle and returns the area.
# The area formula is (base * height) / 2.
#
# Examples:
# calculate_area_triangle(10, 5) should return 25.0.
# calculate_area_triangle(7, 3) should return 10.5.
#
# Define your function and call it below.
def calculate_area_triangle(base, height):
    area = (base * height) / 2
    return area


print('Exercise 1:', calculate_area_triangle(10, 5))


# Exercise 2: Calculate Simple Interest
#
# Write a function named `simple_interest` that takes principal, rate of interest (as a percentage), and time (years).
# Calculate and return the simple interest using the formula (principal * rate * time) / 100.
#
# Examples:
# simple_interest(1000, 5, 2) should return 100.
# simple_interest(1500, 3.5, 5) should return 262.5.
#
# Define your function and call it to see the result.
def simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
    return interest

print('Exercise 2:', simple_interest(1000, 5, 2))
